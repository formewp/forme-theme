## Installation

If you're starting a new theme, by far the easiest way forward is to use the cli. [Check the docs](https://formewp.github.io)!

After generating your new project you should copy `phpstan.neon.example` to `phpstan.neon` and fill it in with relevant paths for the WordPress root and the various stubs etc in order for PHP Stan to function.

If you're doing development on this boilerplate, you'll need to git clone this repo.
